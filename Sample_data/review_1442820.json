It's basically exceeded my expectations in almost every way and I just can't put it down.  It's not a game for the faint of heart or for those easily frustrated.  This game will tear you apart but it's so rewarding to find a path forward and to find solutions as it's a shmup but each screen almost plays more like a puzzle that can only be passed with the tools available to you.\n\nI haven't played a shmup in years and it took me about 12 hours to beat the game finally on normal and there's 2 difficulties and a few unplayed branching stages I have yet to find.  I'm going to get well more than my 40 dollars worth.\n\nThe soundtrack and most of the graphics are great, the level and enemy placement is designed tight and with a lot of thought and care.  The game runs great on my pc and I really don't have a lot of complaints.\n\nThere's a few bugs Granzella has acknowledged and a stage or two where the graphics are a bit lacking compared to others.

I want to recommend this game, as I have been a fan of R-Type since the first few games over 30 years ago now. But right now the game has issues, issues that can hopefully be fixed! \n\nRight now the game is buggy, has lag issues during key moments of fights, and has menu glitches that make it impossible to interact with the game if you alt tab out and tab back in. Currently, I have not gotten to any of the final paths of the game (It has branching paths beginning with level 6 depending on a choice you make at the end of level 5, similar to the first Final). However, the reason for this has not been because the game is too hard or I'm bad at it or any complaints with the levels themselves. When I reached level 5 the first time, I died to the final boss on it, alt-tabbed out to check a discord message, and when I came back the game wouldn't do anything. I could not hit continue, I could not select a fighter, nothing. Controller and keyboard become completely unresponsive, no matter what button I pushed I just got nothing or an error sound from the game. \n\nSo I quit it, and retried. Same thing happened when I alt-tabbed again. The menus are also buggy when looking through the bydo labs and the other gallery sections, not properly responding to directional inputs, leaving your input in a spot it wasn't upon exiting out of a menu, etc. \n\nJust now I played again, got through stage 6.2, and the game crashed for the third time today trying to load stage 7.2. \n\ntl;dr Game is good, but currently I cannot recommend it due to constant bugs and crashes  hampering the experience, among other minor nuisances that add up to tedium across the experience. \n\nEven barring all that, as much as I love R-Type, this has less content than R-Type Final on the PS2 and costs $40 plus a $20 season pass for more levels, all while having far less ships than its predecessor. The graphics are phenomenal, but the content is a bit lacking right now, I hope to see more in the future that will change this to a recommended, because more content is still being added, both paid and free. Biggest things that need to be fixed are menu errors, input issues, and the crashes. \n\ntl;dr, again:\nIf you love R-Type, get it\nIf you just like schmups, wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1619982671, "timestamp_updated": 1619982671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522613048553466797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91307989": {"recommendationid": "91307989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034120792", "num_games_owned": 1262, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1619978896}, "language": "english", "review": "I love me some R-Type and this game seriously nails it.

I was a big fan of r-type since the R-type Delta. I've spent too many hours in the RTF1 just to unlock all the ships available. And then comes the RTF2. The gameplay is great, challenging and quite easier to unlock ships compared to the previous one. But there are some cons, the music isn't like the RTF1 as it has the horror ambiance in a certain level. RTF2 OST however, is hyping you to shoot Bydos rather than feel the bydo horror. It's not bad, it just doesn't have the RTF1 style of soundtrack.\n\nThe graphics is okay. The fighter ship details are very good. But there are certain levels that are just too underwhelming. For example in RTF1 stage 3 where you fought the big ship, and it has a very good ship details (very much looks like a proper battleship). In RTF2, The ship design id just a bunch of plain blocks with guns equipped.\n\nI think that this game is still in early access as they are so many things lacking, But then again, i hope the devs improve the game in the upcoming versions as i like to see all of the r-type level being re-release in this game.

And when I'm only on the early stage of this game with very minimum playtime, I'm absolutely can say positive things about the game:\n\n- good graphic and style. Reminded me a lot of R Type Final graphic style, but better and smoother this time. The effect of weapon retain same vibe with R Type 3, even on the early stage you will fight giant mecha same as R Type 3. what a nostalgic scene\n\n- good pace of enemies wave. and it gets tougher on higher difficulty stage with limited space on screen to manuever your ship\n\n- Good variety and design of ships. What is a shooter without good looking and cool ships to choose? This is the reason why I played R Type since back then. And this time, it comes with good range of ships to choose. And I think they still keep the original ships, and similar unit like albatros and cerberus from previous R Type games\n\n- decent customization options for your unit. so far, Im quite satisfied to get opportunity to choose color for lots of ship parts, even add visible decal on your ship\n\nWhat I think Developer need to improve for further patch update:\n- some of menus had difficulty to navigate (either with keyboard or controller). Especially in gallery and several options menu. I find on several occasion its like stuck and kind of difficult to get back to previous menu\n\nOverall this is a really good shooter game, and dare I say its a love letter for shooter and R Type fans.

I think it's kind of sad that fans of the first will miss out on ships they had access to previously.\n\nAlso, the addition of an adaptive difficulty baffles me.  Why pick normal difficulty if it's going to get harder? Why pick bydo or r-typer difficulty if it's going to relent when the player hits a rough patch? \nI don't know who asked for that feature to be added, but the game doesn't seem to benefit from it in any way unless they plan on removing the difficulty selection altogether.  My opinion, not gospel.\n\nR-Type Final 2 manages to be prettier than Final 1, but I feel the level design leaves a lot to be desired.  To that end, if the player finds themselves using only 1 out of 99 available ships because the stage layout renders the others almost useless, there must be an issue with the level design.\n\nAll that said, it's not bad, nor unplayable.

Anyone familiar with the R-Type franchise knows what they're getting into for the most part here.  It's not like the Danmakus and Gradius-like shmups that require super fast reflexes, but it's more about strategy, atmosphere, and the story-telling as told through the level design.  I remember still being in high school when I pre-ordered R-Type Final 1 for PS2 from Gamestop and I was so excited to discover all the levels and unlock all the ships.  A lot of those levels back then were a little too long, so it's nice to see the levels in this sequel shortened, similar to the very original R-Types in a way.  However, I do miss the bits of quotes and story that were in Final 1 to add a little more depth and intrigue into the gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous and everything runs smoothly on a decent machine.  Performance-wise, this is what R-Type FInal 1 should have been as I did go back to playing it last year on my PS2 and found everything so sluggish.  You basically have to emulate it on PCSX2 to get it to feel and play more like Final 2.\n\nBeing such a fan of the series, I did pre-order the high end collector's edition for PS4 from the NIS America website mainly for the awesome R9-A metal earth model.  It was nice to receive it early and try out the game a couple days before release, but I can definitively say you must get it on Steam if you have a machine capable of running it smoothly 60-144fps with no hiccups.  At least your chances of dying due slight frame rate stutters will be lessened lol.\n\nAt the backed price of $30, to get the game and all the DLC that was planned is a fantastic price.  At the price of $65ish for the complete package and digital copies of the OST and art book is still pretty good... 11 main stages and (I think) 6 planned DLC stages?  99 ships to unlock.  I mean, I bought Dariusburst Chronicles with all the DLC when it was on sale at some point, and have only played it a handful of times, finding everything to be just a little too generic.

Yes, 18 years ago.  However, I believe very firmly that Final 2 is a beautiful ode to that which Irem had established R-Type, in general, had evolved into by the time Final 1 had come out, in a much sleeker and more pleasing aesthetic than Final 1 offered (my God I hated Final 1's menu aesthetic and sounds, and Final 2's are great).  In essence, I'd argue Granzella did [i]not[/i] drop the ball on how it [i]feels[/i] to play an R-Type game - I think they got the overall feel correct.\n\nAs [i]for[/i] feel, not only should I mention that the ships seem to control fine, but difficulty is part of feel as well, and yeah, R-Type has historically been on the hard side; Final 2 is merely no different in that regard and thus also hits [i]that[/i] nail on the head - \"R-Type\" and \"particularly easy\" just [i]don't[/i] traditionally go in the same sentence together, so you simply [i]can't[/i] go into Final 2 expecting the game to just keel over for you.  Effort is required to beat this game.  For what it's worth, I felt that Practice difficulty here feels to me about as hard overall as Baby (the equivalent difficulty) did on Final 1.\n\nThe stage design also seems pretty spot-on for general obstacle placement and difficulty of navigation; it is good modernization of the notions of what Irem themselves previously put us through in Delta and Final 1.  I will also give HUGE praise to stage 6 of Final 2 for the wheel cycles being [i]amazing[/i] and giving you extra opportunities for entrance/exit that you might not have thought you'd have: some previous games - R-Type III being the worst offender by far - had situations where Irem was [i]VERY[/i] unfair with cycles, automatic doors, walls, or other hair-pulling stage design elements; Final 2 never throws any wholly unfair stage design stuff at you, and I see that as fantastic.\n\nI think the main takeaways here should be:\n* We should count ourselves [i]considerably[/i] lucky that after [i]18 years[/i] we even [i]have[/i] a new mainline R-Type game [i]at all[/i], regardless of who made it.\n* We should be happy that Granzella has managed to get it as right as they [i]have[/i] - I agree with their cheesy tagline that Final 2 is \"the best R-Type we can make now.\"\n* I recommend that any fan of R-Type in general play Final 2; I feel that any actually-reasonable human being familiar with the series won't be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1619897016, "timestamp_updated": 1619897016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652311325073242188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91245627": {"recommendationid": "91245627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048601033", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 489, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1619990767}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't recommend getting your force stuck in the little shop of horrors enough!", "timestamp_created": 1619895200, "timestamp_updated": 1619895200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91244806": {"recommendationid": "91244806", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968555512", "num_games_owned": 723, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 289, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1619972840}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a bit wary of the switch to 3D graphics and the Unreal Engine, as one of the things I loved about R-Type was the excellent bitmap graphics, but they have really made it work here.

The legendary side-scroller is back and better than ever with beautifully rendered 3D graphics, exhilarating shoot-'em-up gameplay, and a multitude of stages, ships, and weapons that will allow you to conduct a symphony of destruction upon your foes.\n\n[h1][b]Nyanco's Review : [/b][/h1]\n[b]Taking off again... R-TYPE FINAL 2 is now live![/b]\n\nThe R-TYPE series is one of if not the milestone in side-scrolling shooter games. The developer Granzella is licensed by Irem Software Engineering (the original developer of the R-TYPE series) and made R-TYPE FINAL 2. This game tries to go back to its roots by adhering to the pursuit of playability and exhilaration. The R-TYPE series features a weapon called the Wave Cannon that is an energetically charged cannon with strong offensive capability and Force that is remote-controlled for protecting the fighter which can be attached to the front or the rear of the fighter to fire laser beams. In other words, the gameplay requires that players make full use of the Wave Cannon and it\u2019s force to smash formidable enemies.\n\nThis game is designed so that the players can experience the feeling of exhilaration in the destruction of their enemies meaning it is thoroughly reliant on the feeling of how enemies are destroyed. Another interesting thing about the R-TYPE series is that not only does the player's fighter evolve, but the stages do too. The game has 10 or more original R-Type Final 2 stages from the start. Moreover, new stages are planned to be added after the release of the game, according to the developer's commentary. New types of player fighters will be developed as you progress through the depth of its gameplay. One of the most enjoyable parts of the game is finding aircraft that are effective in passing the stages that are difficult or finding the type of aircraft you like. The tension and thrill of cutting your way through huge alien enemies is something that only R-Type can offer. We highly recommended R-TYPE FINAL 2!\n\n[h1][b]Side Note[/b][/h1]\n[code]Looking for nice anime games? Let's take a look with Nyanco-chan! [b]Follow Nyanco Channel!

It can (and 3.0 straight up will) look jarring, but at least for me it doesn't take away from the overall experience of the game.\n\nI haven't played long enough to explore the depth of the ship variety, but for what I've seen they did a stellar job in that regard. The various vehicles maintain the same feel as their R-Type Final counterparts, their models and particle effects are beautiful and the customization, while not flawless, allows for some very fun tinkering with the look of your vehicles.\n\nUnlocking the ships is way different than in Final, where you were required X minutes of playtime with another specific vehicle for most of them; here, you have to buy them with currency obtained by beating levels, which means you are no longer forced to fly ships you may not like for long periods of time, but you're also not rewarded for failure anymore - whereas in Final you could die over and over and over in one section while still making progress towards the unlocks, here you'll need to reach and defeat the boss to earn the currency... But on the plus side, you can progress even just by playing your favorite ship this time around.\n\nOverall for what I've played, this game is a solid 7.5/10 - despite its flaws it's a very pleasant and fun experience, and I plan to keep going to see all this game has to offer. And while more content will indeed be welcome (not that this game is lacking in that department, quite the opposite), I'd love to see some graphical tweaks in the future to make the overall aesthetic of the game become truly beautiful to look at.", "timestamp_created": 1619865411, "timestamp_updated": 1619865411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585500538349151611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91218445": {"recommendationid": "91218445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971613178", "num_games_owned": 776, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 679, "playtime_at_review": 679, "last_played": 1620027692}, "language": "english", "review": "My downthumb for this game is based mostly on it's $40 price tag.

The texture quality and polygon count takes a major dive in certain levels and its a serious shame (Look at this late game boss: https://i.imgur.com/FLYZVEq.png). On top of that the music is entirely forgettable. They did a good job of making the first few levels and especially the player ships and selection screens look really good but that's it. You have 99 ships or so to unlock but there's only about 7 levels to play (10 with DLC). No graphics quality options, buggy controller support... Sometimes even the gameplay is frustrating due to cheapshot enemy attacks and dated movement mechanics. You can use an analogue stick but its still 8 way movement with buttons that shift you through 4 speed levels.... come on now, was this made for arcades? No? Then design the game with analogue control. I realize that's not traditional for R-Type, but still, lets get with the times.

I've been waiting for years for another game that takes what previous R-Type games did but better and.....well. It's more R-Type but i think a good explanation is in order. \n\nFirst up, it feels and plays just like Delta/Final in a good way. Ship with a unforgiving hitbox, force core at the front. Speed up and down buttons to adjust movement. This is 100% a R-Type game, with plenty of ships to use and unlock. The problem is that it's trying to be the early R-Type games while also trying to be like Delta/Final, but it's drawing on too much from the former than the latter. Considering that this game was marketed like it was going to be more Delta/Final than R-Type 1/2/3 it's somewhat misleading.\n\nTwo big examples is the OST and the Level design. There's too much energy in the music for the most part and it seems to have some pacing issues (perhaps a technical issue?). It's not bad music mind you, but it feels like it would had fit a more retro-themed or hard-core game. Now the Level design....OH BOY. This...this is a doozy for me. It doesn't make good use of it's '3D space'. It feels like you're always travelling on a line. \n\n\"But R-Type games have you always travelling on a line.\"\n\nTrue for the early games but again, Delta and Final did things to compensate. Interesting Rotations of the background, moving the scenery about, water effects and it had enemies come in and out of the scene in cool ways. Final 2 meanwhile only uses it for the most part to rotate into another 'line'. It feels like a waste of the UT4 engine.\n\nIn addition, some of the checkpoints and enemy placement are completely unforgiving. There's one point on stage 4 that is literal cancer if you don't have a weapon for it prior. And if you die at that point of the stage you have to do it without access to any weapon other than your wave cannon and if your wave cannon can't deal with what are basically solid objects then you're done, restart the game because it would be faster to get back to that area instead of trying to futilely throw yourself into what is essentially several walls made of angry flesh.\n\nVisuals are also mixed bag. On one hand you can get some really nice shots here and there with sweeping views of space, planets in the background with objects in-between to create a lovely setting. On the other you have objects close up that look like melted chocolate. I think something may be broke with the LoD on them. At least the game runs silky smooth (For me at least).\n\nAll in all. I really wish there was a 'neutral' button for a review. The game is enjoyable enough with solid gameplay and tons of unlockables. You'll generally have a good time if you're a Shmup fan but it does seem to lack a bit of it's predecessors soul.", "timestamp_created": 1619838723, "timestamp_updated": 1619838723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91203983": {"recommendationid": "91203983", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988888795", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 389, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1619923820}, "language": "english", "review": "If you loved Rype final or rtype in general get this, not a bullet hell", "timestamp_created": 1619837689, "timestamp_updated": 1619837689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "91203363": {"recommendationid": "91203363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965472349", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 967, "playtime_at_review": 543, "last_played": 1620006032}, "language": "english", "review": "i can't believe it was like 17 years ago since R-type Final on PS2.

Although this game was crowdfunded, I was not an early backer; I'm just a fan of the genre and the R-Type series.\n\nAlso, you can skip the first lengthy bullet below if this isn't your first foray into R-Type.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n    \u2022 What separates the R-Type series most from other side-scrolling shmups is the inclusion of a \"Force\" -- the large orb you see hovering in front of your ship. All ships have such a Force that the player can leave attached, launch forward, leave out in space, and recall back to them at will. During the Force's return, the player can also fly ahead of the Force and back into it, effectively attaching it to your ship's rear instead. In all cases, the Force will emit its own (friendly) projectiles, invincibly block/destroy most all incoming (enemy) projectiles, and usually serve at least one other utilitarian purpose unique to your chosen ship's loadout (e.g., working as an independently flying companion when not attached to you, or projecting an even larger shield to deflect more bullets with, etc). On paper, this feature might seem novel at best, but in practice, it defines a major portion of R-Type's unique gameplay, strategies, and customization. Watching any duration of any gameplay videos of either R-Type Final or R-Type Final 2 should suffice for learning the significance and value of a ship's Force (and the player's ability to manipulate it).\n\n    \u2022 Kazuma Kujo (the game designer and producer for several R-Type releases, including R-Type Final) nailed the audio and visual presentation of R-Type Final 2, making the nostalgic portion of the experience all the more rewarding for former R-Type players. Moreover, the diversity in ship weapons (be it melee attacks, bouncing lasers, droppable bombs, sidekick projectile emitters, heat-seeking missiles, auto-aiming turrets, and everything in between) remains true to what I expected from a modern R-Type title.\n\n    \u2022 The 16:9 aspect ratio \"upgrade\" (from its predecessor's 4:3 aspect) measurably improves gameplay by allowing you to see upcoming enemies and obstacles in greater detail from further away, etc.\n\n    \u2022 Beyond your basic 8-directional shmup controls, the in-game ship mappings include a rapid-fire button (which fires your basic weapon at the maximum rate your weapon allows, negating any need/advantage of rapid button-mashing). You are also given dedicated buttons for slowing down and speeding up your ship's agility (that is, how fast your ship can navigate the screen-space and avoid incoming projectiles/obstacles, not how fast you progress horizontally through the level) for quick escapes or precise dodging on the fly.\n\n\n[h1]SETTINGS[/h1]\n    \u2022 You pick from 5 difficulty settings at the beginning of each run (Practice, Kids, Normal, Bydo, and R-Typer). These seem to simply adjust the number of enemies/projectiles on-screen at any given time (and perhaps their health).\n\n    \u2022 There are options to play at up to 360 FPS at 4K resolution.\n\n    \u2022 You can change the controller icons used to Keyboard, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch styles.\n\n    \u2022 You are offered fully remappable controls for both keyboard and gamepads.\n\n    \u2022 While there are no colorblind-related accessibility settings, I have not had any situations arise where obscure color-coding played an important role.\n\n\n[h1]SHIPS[/h1]\n    \u2022 The interface seems to indicate room for 99 flyable ships in total, however, it is my understanding that not all 99 are currently present and unlockable. (The developers are quick to advertise their intention to add new content to the game post-launch, so take that as you will.) Regardless, each ship has its own projectiles, uniquely meaningful upgrades, powerful charge shots, interesting Force mechanics, and so on. And it is this diversity in customizable ships (and the gradual unlocking of them) that drives a big part of the game's \"fun factor\" and replayability.\n\n    \u2022 The \"R Museum\" (a giant warehouse showcasing your entire ship collection) from R-Type Final is fully-realized in 3D, complete with a ground-level first-person mode for exploring and viewing your collection, and a focused view to see all your individual ships from all angles while you read immersion-friendly descriptions of their loadouts, etc.\n\n    \u2022 You start the game with 3 ships unlocked, and all ships appear to be customizable. The customization interface offers 8 body colors, full RGB canopy selection (~16 million colors), 61 *extremely generic* decals that can be rotated and positioned anywhere on your ship's body as you see fit (with more optionally unlocked later), 12 missile options (with only 2 unlocked initially), and 12 companion \"bits\" (smaller projectile emitters that closely follow your ship, of which only 1 or 2 are unlocked initially), all provided and saved on a per-ship basis.\n\n    \u2022 Beyond the initial 3 ships unlocked from the start, new ships and modifications are unlocked through either crafting materials gathered in-game or bought via currency earned in-game (sans a few exceptions locked behind game progression accordingly).\n\n    \u2022 4 ships are locked behind (all lowercase) passwords entered in the R Museum: [spoiler]The R-Type Discord guild discovered Ship #3, the R-9A3 LADYLOVE, password: loveandpeace. Twitter user bandana5656 discovered Ship #24, R-9B STRIDER, password: granzella.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]GRIPES SO FAR[/h1]\n    \u2022 The length of the game is decent for an arcade-style shmup at the intended (or harder) difficulty, as countless lives will be lost as you learn the ins and outs of each stage. (The struggle of progression is similar to challenging \"Mario Maker\" levels, if that means anything to you.) But I suspect fans of the easier modes will find its 7 current levels unexpectedly short and unrewarding.\n\n    \u2022 As can be gleaned from the promotional videos and screenshots provided in Steam, the background during gameplay is bright, detailed, and interesting *almost* to a fault. While I do not believe it has measurably affected my performance in a level yet, I wouldn't be surprised to learn a portion of the playerbase was struggling to distinguish the foreground threats from the background art at the reflexive speed the game requires at harder (and thus \"busier\") difficulties. An easy fix would be the introduction of an option that allowed players to either dim the background significantly or toggle it off altogether.\n\n    \u2022 The game requires text-typing in a few select areas (naming your \"pilot\", inputting backer codes if you have any, etc), and attempts to leverage an in-game keyboard to accomplish this. Unfortunately, this was clearly a rushed \"feature\", as its implementation is beyond clunky and mandates you to use your mouse every time it comes up (even just to close it, which confusingly is done by clicking the \"Enter\" button on the virtual keyboard, regardless if you're trying to back out of it, return to the previous menu, or submit the text you've entered). Until this is fixed, using your mouse to click the \"Enter\" button is a simple workaround for this one-time issue.\n\n    \u2022 It's perhaps an insignificant shortcoming, but the initial 61 decals available to customize your ship with are *unreasonably* generic and wildly irrelevant to this game, its setting, and the genre as a whole. Among the most notable examples are a music note, a water drop, an exclamation point, 3 separate hearts (including one with with Cupid's arrow piercing it), a red lipstick kiss mark, and a crossed fork and knife. It genuinely feels like a barebones pack of public domain clip art symbols sourced from a handful of indie collections by various artists. Fortunately, you can unlock more pertinent decals with in-game currency as you progress.\n\n\n\n[table] [tr] [th]If this review was helpful, please say so via the button below.

R-Type Final 1 is one of my favorite shoot-em-ups so I'm glad to see just another R-Type in general.\n\nAll the ships are lovingly rendered, though the stages come off as a bit samey and simplistic (only played up to stage 4 as of this review). There's a lot of nice little touches. The bosses are pretty creative, and riff on other bosses in the series which is nice.\n\nFinal 2 has... differences I'm not sure about. I like that the stages are shorter and you get a ton of credits by only playing a couple hours, and I LOVE that you don't need to play ships for a certain amount of time, you just grind the three currencies to buy them. Which... is its own thing, but at least I get to choose what ship I want while I grind.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like the game is a lot stingier when it comes to checkpoints; not in the amount, but that you'll restart and have to navigate the stage without a Force for a while. At least it means I have to get good.\n\nI don't think it's a perfect game, but I wasn't expecting it to be. I wanted another R-Type, and another Final at that, and I think this is a great fulfillment of that vision.

Turns out demo can only play on PS platform or the NINTENDO SWTICH.\nabout early access? by the time steam version got unlock and downloadable those who got either physics CD version or DMM platform or buy the normal version have already play throuh the game.\nGuess how I found out? OH COME GUYS IT'S ALREADY ON THE YOUTUBE! THE WHOLE PLAY THROUH. Don't know why they doing this stab right back to PC and the XBOX. \nEnough about blaming.\n[/spoiler]\n\nTo those of who are not the backers, don't miss this one---no brainer . I mean this is THE R-TYPE made by latest graphic those stuff, it's absolutely stunning. Ask your self when was last time you saw a sort of \"bleeding edge\" STG? like: YEEEEEEEES!!!!!!! This is it! This is how these type of the game gose at current gen!\nMy answer is: Nah... didn't saw much and most of it are those old game backing the day, worse of it with tag \"danmaku\" this type of the game the only easy part is have tones of the bullet just throw at player don't have about nice good or stunning look of the modeling details and every one of them except art design and music is deffrient every thing is same player hit box is this tiny wee little dot and faceing tones bullet if player can't handle it it will have the mechanism to erase those danmaku give player  invincible for a sec. \nAnd then the difficulty they got this, unlike thoes \"danmaku\" game hard part is the most easy part and boring part. This one to noob or for new player as the rank gose up harder to master,this is a very awesome part of this game:easy play hard to master.Plus there will be 102 ships to unlock pretty sure it's gonna spend lots of time to beat this game.\n\nAnd the down side, actually the big one it's just DLCs but game update and those who made this update are not machines they're humans so under normal circumstances beside breathing \nis free every single move need money even game update. The other one probably is they don't have the Infinity life mode back from R-TYPE Dimensions EX, fingers cross they'll add in~\n\nThat's it.Take off again!!!!!HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!
